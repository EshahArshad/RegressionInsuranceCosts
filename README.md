# RegressionInsuranceCosts
This project applies machine learning to predict health insurance costs. Using linear regression and advanced methods, we analyze how factors like age and BMI affect prices. It's focused on understanding insurance cost dynamics.
We look at how things like age, BMI, and whether someone smokes affect insurance prices. The project includes basic data analysis and tries different ways to make predictions, like linear regression and some special techniques to improve accuracy. It's all about finding out what makes insurance costs go up or down
